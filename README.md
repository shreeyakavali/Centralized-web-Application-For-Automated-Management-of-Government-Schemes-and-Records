# Centralized-web-Application-For-Automated-Management-of-Government-Schemes-and-record
Government departments often face challenges in coordinating and updating records across various schemes and services. Manual processes can lead to delays, errors, and inefficiencies. A centralized system that automates these processes can significantly improve service delivery and ensure that benefits are managed appropriately.

The objective of this project is to develop a centralized web application that streamlines the management of government schemes and records, particularly focusing on automating the updating of records such as death certificates and subsequently halting related benefits (e.g., pensions). This system aims to enhance efficiency, transparency, and accuracy in government operations.
